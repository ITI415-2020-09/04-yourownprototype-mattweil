# Cube Destroyer

Using the concepts learned from previous assignments, I built Cube Destroyer. The game uses arrow keys to adjust the cannon's position. The objective is to destroy at least 6 cubes using 5 shots or less. The walls can be used to bounce the projectile, a concept I found really entertaining from the game 'Bloons'.
